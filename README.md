1. As a user, I want to add todos so that I can add more task.
2. As a user, I want to edit todos so that I fix necessary changes/mistakes.
3. As a user, I want to remove todos so that I only keep todos I need.
4. As a user, I want to see all my todos so that I know what I need to do.
5. As a user, I want to check off a todo so that I know which todo I completed
6. As a user, I want to see all active todos so that I know which todos I still need to do.
7. As a user, I want to clear all todos with one button so that I can efficiently restart my todo list
